# University Python Projects Repository

This repository contains my Python projects for university courses. 
Each project is organized in its own folder. 

- The main repository provides an overview of all projects.
- Each project folder can have its own separate README.md file to provide detailed information specific to that project.

This structure makes it easy to manage multiple projects in one place while keeping each project well-documented and organized.
