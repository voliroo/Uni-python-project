Project?
An interactive Python program that re-implements almost all common string methods like upper, lower, strip, replace, find, count, center, startswith, etc. — completely from scratch, without using a single built-in string method! 😎
Everything is written manually using basic loops, ord(), chr(), slicing, and pure logic.

It has a nice menu where you can test each method live on your own string and even save the result as the new current string.
Perfect for understanding exactly how Python's str methods work under the hood.

Why did I make this project?
Because my professor said:

"For the final project, you are not allowed to use any built-in string methods. Implement them yourself."

So… I did exactly that 😂

This project is more of a brain exercise and learning tool than a real-world utility. But hey, it’s great for really understanding Python!
(If you see me writing all this, it’s only for the grade — otherwise, I’d never touch this in my life 😂)
